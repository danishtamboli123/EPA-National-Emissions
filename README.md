# EPA National Emissions 1999-2008

## What is NEI?

* The National Emissions Inventory (NEI) is a comprehensive and detailed estimate of air emissions of criteria pollutants, criteria precursors, and hazardous air pollutants from air emissions sources.
* The NEI is released every three years based primarily upon data provided by State, Local, and Tribal air agencies for sources in their jurisdictions and supplemented by data developed by the US EPA.
* The NEI is built using the Emissions Inventory System (EIS) first to collect the data from State, Local, and Tribal air agencies and then to blend that data with other data sources.

## What are the 4 Sources of pollution and How are they Categorized?

### NEI point sources
* Emissions estimates for larger sources that are located at a fixed, stationary location.  Point sources in the NEI include large industrial facilities and electric power plants, airports, and smaller industrial, non-industrial and commercial facilities.
* A small number of portable sources such as some asphalt or rock crushing operations are also included. Some states voluntarily also provide facilities such as dry cleaners, gas stations, and livestock facilities, which are otherwise included in the NEI as nonpoint sources.  
* The emissions potential of each facility determines whether that facility should be reported as a point source, according to emissions thresholds set in the Air Emissions Reporting Rule (AERR). 
* NEI Point Sources are all included in the EIS Point Data Category.

### NEI nonpoint sources
* Emissions estimates for sources which individually are too small in magnitude to report as point sources.  
* These emissions sources are included in the NEI as a county total or tribal total (for participating tribes).  
* Examples include residential heating, commercial combustion, asphalt paving, and commercial and consumer solvent use.  
* NEI nonpoint sources are all included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category. 

### NEI onroad sources
* Emissions from onroad vehicles that use gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. These sources include light duty and heavy duty vehicle emissions from operation on roads, highway ramps, and during idling.  Except for California, the US EPA uses the MOVES model to compute onroad source emissions based on model inputs provided by State, Local, and Tribal air agencies.  
* California provides emissions to the US EPA based on a California-specific model.  The MOVES model also computes refueling emissions, which are included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category. 
* All other onroad source emissions are included in the EIS Onroad Data Category.

### NEI nonroad sources 
* Off-road mobile sources that use gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. Source types include construction equipment, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft ground support equipment, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels. 
* For many nonroad sources, the EPA uses the MOVES-NONROAD model and these sources are included in the EIS nonroad Data Category. Starting with the 2008 NEI, some nonpoint sources are included in other EIS Data Categories. 
* Aircraft engine emissions (occurring during landing and takeoff operations) and the ground support and power unit equipment are included in the EIS Point Data Category at airport locations. Locomotive emissions at rail yards are also included in the EIS Point Data Category. 
* Emissions of other locomotive emissions and of commercial marine vessel emissions (both underway and port emissions) are included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category.

## Initial Analysis and Categorization of the Dataset.

#### Total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008:

![BarPlot](/Plots/Plot1.png "Total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008")

* From the above Bar plot we can conclude that the is a drastic decrease in the Total Emissions over the years.


#### Quantile of Emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008:

![Boxplot](/Plots/Plot1_Boxplot.png "Quantile of emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008")

* From the Above graph we can see the Median (50th Percentile),the 25th and 75th Percentile all are decreasing from 1999 to 2008.
* The change from 1999 to 2002 is more drastic than from 2002 to 2008.
* We also notice the spread (Whiskers) are wider in the Later Years.
* Even the Outliners in years from 2002 onward show a greater range.
* All of this can be validated by running a summary on each of these.

#### Total emissions from PM2.5 in the  Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008:

![Boxplot](/Plots/Plot3_BoxPlot.png "Types of sources of Emission,and their respective Quantile of Emissions for Baltimore City,from the period 1999-2008")

* From the Above graph we can see the Median (50th Percentile),the 25th and 75th Percentile all are decreasing from 1999 to 2008,across all types
* In the case of NON-ROAD, NONPOINT and ON-ROAD The change from 1999 to 2002 is more drastic than from 2002 to 2008.
* In the case of POINT The change is pretty gradual across all years,but is more drastic from 2005 to 2008.
* We also notice the spread (Whiskers) are wider in the years following 1999.
* The Outliners in years from 2002 onward show a greater range.
* All of this can be validated by running a summary on each of these.
